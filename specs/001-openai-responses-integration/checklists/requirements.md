# Specification Quality Checklist: OpenAI Responses Integration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ Specification avoids Go-specific or implementation terminology
- ✅ Focus maintained on developer outcomes (productivity, reliability, compliance)
- ✅ Language accessible to product managers and technical architects
- ✅ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) fully populated

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all requirements use reasonable defaults per prompt guidelines
- ✅ Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-013) includes testable acceptance criteria
- ✅ Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) specify measurable metrics with concrete thresholds
- ✅ Success criteria avoid technology references (e.g., "developers can complete" vs "Go code compiles")
- ✅ All four user stories include Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- ✅ Six edge cases identified covering stability, compliance, and resilience concerns
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded to OpenAI Responses API integration (excludes fine-tuning, embeddings, etc.)
- ✅ Assumptions section documents seven explicit design decisions (API key storage, concurrency model, etc.)

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- ✅ User stories prioritized by developer value (onboarding → structured outputs → conversations → streaming)
- ✅ Each user story independently testable per template requirements
- ✅ Functional requirements map to success criteria (e.g., FR-001/FR-002 → SC-003 schema validation)
- ✅ No implementation leakage detected (validated by tech-stack filter review)

**Documentation References**:
- All capabilities cite supporting evidence from `docs/providers/openai.md` with line ranges
- Satisfies constitution Principle VI (Doc-Led Implementation Guardrails)
- Reference coverage:
  - Lines 8-931: Quickstart, authentication, request/response patterns (FR-001 through FR-005, FR-013)
  - Lines 934-1344: Text generation, prompting, output structure (FR-012, User Story 1)
  - Lines 2193-4038: Structured outputs, schema enforcement (FR-011, User Story 2)
  - Lines 7095-7400: Conversation state management (User Story 3)
  - Lines 7618-7751: Streaming events and patterns (FR-008, User Story 4)

## Result

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification ready for planning phase

All checklist items verified. Specification meets quality standards for proceeding to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

No clarifications required - all design decisions made using reasonable defaults aligned with industry standards and OpenAI SDK patterns.
