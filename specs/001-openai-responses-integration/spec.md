# Feature Specification: OpenAI Responses Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-openai-responses-integration`  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "OpenAI Responses integration - building a Go-first SDK that reproduces the Vercel AI mental model while enforcing strongly typed provider contracts, an extensible provider interface, and responsible usage compliance"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Developer Onboarding with First API Call (Priority: P1)

A developer new to the SDK wants to generate text from OpenAI within minutes of discovering the package, without reading extensive documentation or understanding complex configuration patterns.

**Why this priority**: First-run success is critical for adoption. If developers can't generate their first response within 5 minutes, they'll abandon the SDK for alternatives. This story validates the core value proposition: simplicity without sacrificing power.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing the SDK, setting an API key via environment variable, and executing a single function call that returns structured text output. Success means receiving a valid response with no additional configuration, demonstrating immediate productivity.

**Documentation Reference**: `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 8-931 (Quickstart onboarding flow showing minimal setup and first API call patterns)

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer has installed the SDK and set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in their environment, **When** they call the client with a simple text prompt, **Then** they receive a typed response object containing the generated text within seconds
2. **Given** a developer provides an invalid or missing API key, **When** they attempt to create a client or make a request, **Then** they receive a clear error message identifying the configuration issue and suggesting remediation steps
3. **Given** a developer makes their first successful request, **When** they inspect the response object, **Then** they can access text output through intuitive property names without consulting documentation

### User Story 2 - Structured Output Workflows (Priority: P2)

A developer building a data extraction pipeline needs to ensure the model returns JSON conforming to a predefined schema, eliminating the need for custom validation logic and retry loops when the model produces malformed responses.

**Why this priority**: Structured outputs are a differentiator for production applications. Developers waste significant time building validation and retry infrastructure. By guaranteeing schema compliance at the SDK level, we reduce integration complexity and improve reliability for real-world use cases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by defining a schema (using native language constructs), passing it to the SDK, and verifying that every response validates against that schema without custom parsing logic. Success means zero schema validation failures across multiple invocations with varied prompts.

**Documentation Reference**: `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 2193-4038 (Structured model outputs covering JSON schema enforcement, type safety guarantees, and schema adherence patterns)

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer defines a structured schema for calendar event extraction, **When** they request a response with that schema, **Then** the SDK returns a validated object that maps directly to their schema definition
2. **Given** the model generates a response that would violate the schema, **When** the SDK processes the response, **Then** the SDK surfaces a structured refusal or error without exposing malformed data to the caller
3. **Given** a developer uses deeply nested or complex schema definitions, **When** they submit requests, **Then** the SDK correctly serializes the schema and deserializes responses without data loss or type coercion issues

---

### User Story 3 - Multi-Turn Conversation Management (Priority: P3)

A developer building a conversational application needs to maintain context across multiple exchanges without manually constructing message arrays or tracking conversation state in application code.

**Why this priority**: Conversation state management is error-prone and repetitive. While critical for chatbot applications, this functionality builds on the foundation of single-request flows (P1) and doesn't block core text generation use cases. Developers can manually manage state initially if needed.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by initiating a conversation, making multiple related requests that reference previous context, and verifying that responses reflect the accumulated conversation history. Success means correct context propagation without requiring developers to explicitly pass message arrays on each call.

**Documentation Reference**: `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 7095-7400 (Conversation state patterns, context chaining, and window management strategies)

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer initiates a conversation with an initial prompt, **When** they make a follow-up request referencing "it" or "that" from the first exchange, **Then** the model's response demonstrates awareness of the prior context
2. **Given** a conversation exceeds the model's context window, **When** the developer attempts to add more turns, **Then** the SDK either truncates appropriately or surfaces a clear error about context limits
3. **Given** a developer wants to inspect conversation history, **When** they request the current state, **Then** they receive a structured representation of all turns in the conversation

---

### User Story 4 - Streaming Response Handling (Priority: P4)

A developer building an interactive UI wants to display model output incrementally as it's generated, rather than waiting for the complete response, improving perceived responsiveness for long-form content.

**Why this priority**: Streaming enhances user experience but isn't required for functional correctness. Many use cases (batch processing, API integrations) don't benefit from streaming. Developers can use non-streaming responses initially without blocking their work.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by enabling streaming mode and capturing incremental text chunks as they arrive, then verifying the aggregated chunks match a non-streaming response for the same prompt. Success means receiving partial content in under 1 second while full responses still generate correctly.

**Documentation Reference**: `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 7618-7751 (Streaming API patterns, server-sent events handling, and event-driven response processing)

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer enables streaming for a request, **When** the model generates output, **Then** they receive typed events for each text delta before the full response completes
2. **Given** a streaming request encounters an error mid-generation, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the SDK emits an error event and terminates the stream gracefully without leaving open connections
3. **Given** a developer wants to cancel a streaming request, **When** they invoke cancellation, **Then** the stream terminates immediately and releases associated resources

---

### Edge Cases

- **Long-lived streaming sessions**: When streaming responses exceed expected duration (>60 seconds), the SDK must maintain connection stability without memory leaks or zombie goroutines, respecting configurable timeout policies
- **Rate limit exhaustion**: When OpenAI rate limits are reached mid-request, the SDK must surface structured rate limit information (headers, retry-after timing) to callers and optionally apply automatic backoff strategies based on configuration
- **Missing or expired credentials**: When API keys are invalid or revoked, the SDK must fail fast at client initialization or first request with actionable error messages, preventing silent failures or cryptic HTTP errors
- **Network instability**: When transient network failures occur, the SDK must distinguish retryable errors (timeouts, 5xx) from permanent failures (4xx) and apply exponential backoff only for retryable cases
- **Schema evolution**: When OpenAI introduces new response fields or deprecates existing ones, the SDK must handle unknown properties gracefully without breaking deserialization for existing clients
- **Concurrent request limits**: When multiple requests execute concurrently from a single client instance, the SDK must safely share HTTP connections and rate limit state without race conditions or connection pool exhaustion

### Key Entities

- **Request**: Represents a complete call to the OpenAI Responses API
  - Key fields: model (string enum), input (string or message array), instructions (optional string), temperature (optional float 0.0-2.0), max_tokens (optional int), stream (optional bool), text format (optional schema)
  - Validation rules: model must be non-empty, input required unless using prompt templates, temperature/max_tokens within documented ranges
  - Documentation Reference: `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 8-931, 934-1344

- **Response**: Represents the complete output from OpenAI after processing a request
  - Key fields: id (string), output (array of output items), usage (token counts), metadata (response tracking)
  - Behavior: Non-streaming returns complete output array; streaming not applicable to this type (see StreamEvent)
  - Error mapping: HTTP 4xx/5xx translate to typed errors with original status code and OpenAI error detail
  - Documentation Reference: `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 934-1344

  - Behavior: Responses may contain multiple items for tool calls or multi-step reasoning
  - Documentation Reference: `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 934-1344

- **ContentPart**: Represents a fragment of content within an output item
  - Key fields: type (enum: output_text, refusal, etc.), text (string), annotations (array)
  - Behavior: Single output item may contain multiple content parts (e.g., text + annotations)
  - Documentation Reference: `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 934-1344

- **StreamEvent**: Represents a single event in a streaming response
  - Key fields: type (enum with 20+ event types), delta (incremental content), item_id (correlation), error (structured error detail)
  - Behavior: Events arrive incrementally; callers accumulate deltas to reconstruct full response
  - Documentation Reference: `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 7618-7751

- **RateLimitInfo**: Represents rate limit state from OpenAI response headers
  - Key fields: limit (max requests per window), remaining (requests left), reset_at (timestamp), retry_after (seconds until retry allowed)
  - Behavior: Attached to responses or errors; used by retry logic and exposed to callers
  - Documentation Reference: Standard HTTP rate limit headers; implied by `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 8-931

- **ClientConfig**: Represents SDK client initialization options
  - Key fields: api_key (string), base_url (string, default "https://api.openai.com/v1"), timeout (duration, default 60s), max_retries (int, default 3), logger (interface)
  - Validation rules: api_key required and non-empty, timeout must be positive, max_retries >= 0
  - Documentation Reference: `docs/providers/openai.md` lines 8-931 (API key and endpoint configuration)

### Assumptions

- **API Key Storage**: Developers will provide API keys via `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or explicit configuration; SDK will not implement key management or rotation
- **Network Environment**: SDK will operate in environments with standard HTTP/HTTPS connectivity; proxy configuration will rely on standard HTTP client environment variables
- **Concurrency Model**: SDK will be safe for concurrent use from multiple goroutines without external synchronization required from callers
- **Error Recovery**: SDK will automatically retry transient failures but will not implement circuit breaker patterns or advanced fallback strategies (caller responsibility)
- **Model Availability**: SDK will accept any model string and rely on OpenAI API to reject invalid models; SDK will not maintain an allowlist of valid models
- **Schema Language**: Structured output schemas will be defined using native language constructs (Go struct tags or similar), not raw JSON Schema strings, improving type safety and developer experience

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can complete their first successful API call (including installation, configuration, and code execution) in under 5 minutes from discovering the SDK, measured by time-to-first-response in onboarding telemetry
  
- **SC-002**: SDK reliably handles 100 concurrent text generation requests without errors, memory leaks, or degraded latency beyond network limitations, validated through load testing with rate limit mocking

- **SC-003**: 95% of structured output requests return valid data matching the provided schema on first attempt without manual validation code, measured by schema validation pass rate in integration tests

- **SC-007**: Developers can integrate SDK into existing projects without external dependencies beyond the standard library (or minimal, well-justified exceptions), measured by dependency count in package manifest

- **SC-008**: SDK documentation and code examples cover all primary use cases (simple text generation, structured outputs, streaming, conversation state) with runnable code samples that execute successfully without modification

- **SC-009**: SDK respects caller-provided timeout and cancellation contexts 100% of the time, terminating requests within 100ms of context cancellation to prevent resource leaks in long-running applications

- **SC-010**: SDK logging and telemetry hooks capture sufficient operational context (correlation IDs, request/response metadata, error details) to debug production issues without requiring code changes, validated by successful root cause analysis of injected failure scenarios
